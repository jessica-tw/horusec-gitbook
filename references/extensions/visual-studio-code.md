## **Features**

### Start Analysis

By starting an analysis, Horusec will run all the security tools needed for your project, then it'll show any vulnerabilities found in the Horusec tab, and in the Diagnostics section. 

You can identify an ongoing analysis when you spot the loading icon displayed at the bottom right bar, as in the image below:

### **Stop analysis**

 ****When you stop the Horusec running analysis, the extension will remove the toolâ€™s analysis image, however this action is not recommended to be performed until the analysis is finished. 

### **Go to the vulnerable code**

In case a vulnerability is founded, the user can investigate it in the Horusec tab or in the Diagnostics section. By clicking on the vulnerability, Horusec will show the exact line that needs to be edited.
