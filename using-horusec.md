# Using Horusec

## Initial set up 

Before you use Horusec, make sure the installation is correct. 

Check the commands below: 

Type the command in your terminal: 

```text
$ horusec version
```

The answer must be: 

```text
Actual version installed of the horusec is: v1.4.0
```

To run Horusec, find the project and activate the command in the terminal: 

```text
$ horusec start
```

After that, the system will do the security analysis of your project. 

If you want to send the analysis to a server, it is necessary to configure an access token of the repository inside  the Horusec interface. 

After you get the token, just run the command below: 

```text
$ horusec start -a=”ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE”
```

Now you can check the vulnerabilities found in an analytical way in Horusec interface. 

## How to use Horusec? 

See below the steps to use Horusec: 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't use Horusec's UI \(user interface\), go straight to step 2.
{% endhint %}

### **Step 1: Access to the platform**

**Step 1.1:** Create your account on your web application _**horusec-manager**_**.**  After that you will receive a confirmation on your email, if this option is enabled:

**Step 1.2:** After that, login and create an organization, click on "Add an organization" and fill the name of your company, then save:

**Step 1.3:**  After that, open the side menu and click on **Repositories;**

* Click on **Create repository, to create one that it** will be saved in the organization selected. 
* Fill the fields and then save.

**Step** **1.4:** Now you have to create an access token, to do so

* Go to the repository you have just created,  on the action section, click on **Tokens;**
* Add token; 
* Now, click on 'New token' and fill the fields. After that save it. 

{% hint style="info" %}
When this token is successfully saved, it will show an access token to the repository, keep it safe and don't share it. 
{% endhint %}

### **Step 2: Project analysis** 

After you have [**installed and configured**](installing-horusec.md) Horusec on your computer, you need to check if it is running correctly,  just type ''horusec version'' on your terminal, you should see this: 

```text
~ ᐅ horusec version
Actual version installed of the horusec is: v1.4.0
```

Now, you have to check if the project has vulnerabilities, for that we will use a random project as an example. 

**Step 2.1:** Define the project and run the following command: 

```text
horusec start -p=”./”
```

**Step 2.2:** Horusec will start the local analysis. It is possible to run this analysis in other place, just type the path where your project is: 

```text
~ ᐅ cd Projects/my-project
~/Projects/my-project (branch-with-vulnerability) ᐅ horusec start -p=”./”
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
On this example, the access token ****was not mentioned, if you want to check horusec's vunelrabilities found in the analytical way, it is necessary to run the command below: 

horusec start -p=”./” -a=”SEU\_TOKEN\_DE\_AUTORIZAÇÃO” -u=”[**https://horusec.io/horusec\_api**](https://horusec.zup.com.br/horus_api)”
{% endhint %}

On the step above, you can see the **-a** flag was added to the access token that was generated in the interface. And the **-u** flag was inserted the link where Horusec's API is hosted to send analysis. 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have any doubt about how each flag for this command works, type in your terminal: **horusec start --help.**
{% endhint %}

### Step 3: Verify the analysis 

Now you have to verify the analysis Horusec is making on the project. The output of the example is: 

```text
~/Projects/my-project (branch-with-vulnerability ✔) ᐅ horusec start -p="./"
WARN[0000] {HORUSEC_CLI} When starting the analysis WE SKIP A TOTAL OF 5 FILES that are not considered to be analyzed. To see more details use flag --log-level=debug 

WARN[0000] {HORUSEC_CLI} PLEASE DON'T REMOVE ".horusec" FOLDER BEFORE THE ANALYSIS FINISH! Don’t worry, we’ll remove it after the analysis ends automatically!
