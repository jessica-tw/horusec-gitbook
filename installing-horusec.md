## Using Horusec with image docker

Another way to carry out your analysis is through a docker image that you can run locally or use in your pipeline. See some examples below:

#### Starting image with run command:

Quando vocÃª inicializa a imagem com o comando de `run` seu ponto de entrada jÃ¡ serÃ¡ por padrÃ£o:`horusec start` sendo assim basta vocÃª adicionar suas flags para executar o comando

When you initialize the image with the `run` command, your entry point will already be by default: `horusec start`, so you just need to add your flags to execute the command.

```text
docker run --privileged -v /path/of/my/project/local:/project -it horuszup/horusec-cli:latest -p /project
```

#### Starting image in your pipeline:

This is an example using the pipeline of [**aws code build**](adding-horusec-in-the-pipeline.md).
